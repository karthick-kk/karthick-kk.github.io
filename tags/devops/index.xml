      <description>Actions are usually developed in the GitHub repository where the project itself is hosted. It is often required to modify these workflows multiple times during its development. This requires a commit to the repo everytime to execute/trigger these workflows.
 ACT ACT is an opensource project that allows us to test these github workflows locally rather than updating the workflow file directly on the github repository.
Refer README for the installation of act.</description>
