      <description>Ingress is meant for 80 and 443 traffic redirects to services running within the cluster. Exposing a service to outside world other than the HTTP traffic is normally done by NodePort service or kubectl port-forward procedure. The former runs on port numbers above 30000 and the later is commonly used for testing. If we need to get our services running on specific port number for external access, then additional configurations are required on the ingress deployment,service and configmap.</description>

      <description>A workaround to get rid of x11/compositor crash in KDE 5.x for Intel HD GPUs
 OpenGL-Compositor crash fix on wakeup/unlock event This is a simple workaround to recover from the kde compositor crashes that renders the screen with black artifacts with non-responding UI.
The idea is to keep a script running in the background which capture the dbus event of lock/unlock screen to restart kwin window manager.
